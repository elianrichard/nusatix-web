   Users select an event or landmark and purchase a ticket, issued as a Soulbound Token (SBT).

   On arrival, proof-of-attendance is verified (e.g., QR scan, geo-verification, etc.).

3. **Receive NFT**  
   A unique NFT is minted to commemorate the visit or event, representing a piece of cultural identity.

## 🔐 Soulbound Token Use

Soulbound Tokens ensure:

- **Authenticity**: Tickets can't be resold or transferred.
